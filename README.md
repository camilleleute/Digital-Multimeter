## P2 - Digital Multimeter

## Reference Materials
- STM32L4xxxx Reference Manual (RM) â€“ General Purpose Timers, ADC, USART
- Technical Note - VT100 Terminal

## Introduction
- The purpose of this project is to design and implement a digital multimeter (DMM) that can measure voltage and frequency to meet the specified requirements below. This project is a more complicated coding challenge than the previous projects and requires a strategy to be formulated before starting the coding. Failure to properly plan out this project ahead of time and implement a solution in smaller testable stages will result in wasting a significant amount of time.

## Objectives
- Understand the challenges of measuring unknown signals
- Gain experience building systems that process data continuously in real time
- Gain experience making design decisions with hardware vs software tradeoffs

  - Voltage measurements shall be accurate to +/- 25 mv
  - Voltage measurements shall be updated at least every 3.5 seconds.
  - The DMM shall have DC and AC measurements.
    - DC and AC measurements can be displayed in separate modes or simultaneously
    - If measurements are displayed in separate modes, the mode selection can be selected manually by the user.
- The DMM DC measurements
  - DC measurement shall be an average of multiple measurements over a constant time period greater than 1 ms and less than 100 ms.

    - AC, DC, and frequency shall be simple to read.
    - The display may use horizontal and vertical lines (borders) to organize the presentation of information.  
  - The terminal shall use character-based bar-graphs for voltages being measured.
    - The bar graphs shall be a single line or column of characters
    - The bar graphs shall have delineators, e.g. a scale, indicating the measured value.
    - The bar graphs shall have a length or height proportional to the value being measured.

## Hints
- Speed up the MCU, running at a minimum of 24 MHz. 
- Run the ADC clock at the fastest clock rate to make the conversion process as quick as possible. Adjust the desired sampling time of the ADC accordingly
- Use a timer to set the start conversion bit at regular intervals for uniform sampling
- Perform the measurement in stages, with the first stage determining the frequency
- A state machine is an ideal mechanism to organize and control the measurement process in stages
